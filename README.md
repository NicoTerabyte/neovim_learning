# neovim learning
A repository to take notes and learn neovim (i know it will take a lot but it is worth it as Vincent said)

## Vim motions and commands:
We move with the hkjl keys we go faster with the wb keys
We can even use in the "esc" mode we may say the bindings with numbers to even go faster
Like for example seeing that w and b keys move from word to word if we were to do 3w we would move 3 words ahead

## The modes
The normal mode for example is the default one that nvim and vim uses to navigate around the text. 
The visual mode works over normal mode it helps us selecting and manipulating multiple text
The insert mode as the name suggest is the one that we use to write/insert stuff as a text in the document

## Basic commands
:q - quits from the current file if you didn't save it would tell you
:qa - quits all open windows
:w - writes the changes in the current file
:wa - // in all the files
:wq - writes the changes and then quits the file
:wqa - does the same as above and then quits

#### little trivia
**vincent** _god bless him_ said that "to have always a look at the tmux bindings press c+b ? Daje
